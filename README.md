uncertainty-gazetteer
=====================

A java-based desktop application providing gazetteer functionality for uncertain places.

The project "Erinnerungslandschaften Jerusalem" collects historical writings from pilgrims. This database program is used to collect and georeference the places denoted in these texts. I created this as part of my work at the chair of computing in the cultural sciences <http://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/kinf>.
